      <h1>The Ailment</h1>
      <p>You just started at your new job at the hospital when suddely a viral outbreak occors. Most of the staff is infected leaving you and a crazy scientest left. The scientist says that he can come up with a cure. But you have have to sort the infected patients out from the other patients. You have to look at patient's charts to see if they have the viris or not. If to many regular patients are sorted into the infected. The hospital will be over run and it's game over also vise versa.</p>
      <p>You will look at patient's charts to see if they are infected or not. Two examples of an infected and healthy patient will be provided. You will use your knolaged that you learned at medical school to figure out who is infected and who isn't. There are four patients that you have to look at. If two or more patients are sorted incorrectly it's game over.</p>
      <p id="gl">Good luck Doctor</p>
